Wrapped up refactoring metadata generation within pip. (yay!) Started refactoring wheel building logic within pip. A few minor fixes/cleanup within pip. Helped out with pip 19.3&amp;rsquo;s release. Significantly simplified pip&amp;rsquo;s release processes. Reviewed &amp;gt;50 PRs. Fixed a &amp;ldquo;major&amp;rdquo; regression in pip&amp;rsquo;s detection of virtual environments.

Figured out a rough structure for approaching pip&amp;rsquo;s build logic refactor. Discussed and sketched a rough &amp;ldquo;goal&amp;rdquo; model for pip&amp;rsquo;s build logic, to adopt after initial cleanups and decoupling refactor work. Made significant progress on refactoring pip&amp;rsquo;s metadata handling and generation logic. (yay!)

Began working on splitting the code for handling of the two kinds of source distributions. Wrap up pip 19.2, with pip 19.2.3 release, unblocking Python 3.8&amp;rsquo;s final beta. Hooray!

What&amp;rsquo;s up? Over the past few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on a prototype for a resolver in pip, spent some time planning what rolling out a new dependency resolver in pip might look like, and continue to work on pip&amp;rsquo;s build logic to decouple it from the dependency resolution logic.
The prototype has helped me better understand the relationships and contracts between various portions of the codebase. This understanding has led me to conclude that it is a worthwhile investment to better decouple the build logic from the resolution logic, then introduce the abstractions defined in resolvelib/zazo, and then proceed to adopting better dependency resolution.</description></item><item><title>Is this thing on?</title><link>https://pradyunsg.me/blog/2019/06/22/is-this-thing-on/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pradyunsg.me/blog/2019/06/22/is-this-thing-on/</guid><description>*tap* *tap*
