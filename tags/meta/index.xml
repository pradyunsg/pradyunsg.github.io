Seems like this is reaching you.
Hello there! I&amp;rsquo;m Pradyun. You probably knew that already. Thanks for spending the time to reach this random piece of writing by me.
Acknowledgements This blog used to be built using Jekyll and the theme was based off Pixyll. The theme was heavily restyled to be more in line with how I wanted my site to look like. I ended up making changes to almost every element of the design, though the layout and colours were solid in Pixyll.</description></item></channel></rss>
