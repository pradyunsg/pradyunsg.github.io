over to <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, and away from <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. This is now built using the
<a href="https://adityatelange.me/blog/papermod-went-viral/">recently-viral</a> <a href="https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/">PaperMod</a> theme for Hugo.</p>
<p>I took the opportunity to refresh/revamp the site structure, which
worked out pretty well too.</p>
<p>Some notes from doing this transition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hugo&rsquo;s separation of content vs templates is GREAT.</li>
<li>Hugo&rsquo;s documentation is exceedingly beginner unfriendly. :(</li>
<li>Hugo&rsquo;s support for <code>{date}-{slug}.md</code> files is&hellip; difficult to
discover.</li>
<li><code>redirect_from</code> == <code>aliases</code></li>
<li>I couldn&rsquo;t search Hugo&rsquo;s changelog, which makes it difficult to figure
out whether something you&rsquo;re reading from a 2018 issue was removed.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Why is this like this&rdquo; and other variants were spoken 17 times, in
the span of 5 hours.</li>
</ul>

Seems like this is reaching you.
Hello there! I&amp;rsquo;m Pradyun. You probably knew that already. Thanks for spending the time to reach this random piece of writing by me.
Acknowledgements This blog used to be built using Jekyll and the theme was based off Pixyll. The theme was heavily restyled to be more in line with how I wanted my site to look like. I ended up making changes to almost every element of the design, though the layout and colours were solid in Pixyll.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>*tap* *tap*</p>
