I figure that it&amp;rsquo;ll be useful to actually write it down in a single place, so that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to repeat myself.
The Python Packaging Authority The Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) is a fairly loose group of projects that happen to be related to Python packaging. While the PyPA has a formal governance model, there&amp;rsquo;s no &amp;ldquo;oversight&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;enforcement&amp;rdquo; on projects that are part of the PyPA &amp;ndash; they are only required to adopt the PSF Code of Conduct and to be accepted by the existing members.</description></item><item><title>Wheels are faster, even for pure Python packages</title><link>https://pradyunsg.me/blog/2022/12/31/wheels-are-faster-pure-python/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pradyunsg.me/blog/2022/12/31/wheels-are-faster-pure-python/</guid><description>When installing with pip (or from PyPI in general), wheels are much faster than source distributions, even for pure-Python projects.
Packages with native code are a clearer win, because the wheel file will contain pre-compiled binaries for the platform you&amp;rsquo;re installing on. This means that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to have a compiler and non-Python build dependencies installed, and you don&amp;rsquo;t need to wait for the compiler to do its thing.</description></item></channel></rss>
