How it works The dotfiles are managed by a Python script. In broad strokes, the script will:
read a TOML file locate the configured paths create symlinks, based on custom marker text in the filenames, for files in subdirectories under the configured paths1 If there&amp;rsquo;s a conflict (i.e. two configured paths provide the same symlink target location), the TOML file contains the resolution for it (i.</description></item><item><title>How the Python Packaging community is organised</title><link>https://pradyunsg.me/blog/2023/01/14/python-packaging-organisation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pradyunsg.me/blog/2023/01/14/python-packaging-organisation/</guid><description>The way the Python packaging community is organised is something that I&amp;rsquo;ve explained in multiple places, in multiple contexts. I figure that it&amp;rsquo;ll be useful to actually write it down in a single place, so that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to repeat myself.
The Python Packaging Authority The Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) is a fairly loose group of projects that happen to be related to Python packaging. While the PyPA has a formal governance model, there&amp;rsquo;s no &amp;ldquo;oversight&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;enforcement&amp;rdquo; on projects that are part of the PyPA &amp;ndash; they are only required to adopt the PSF Code of Conduct and to be accepted by the existing members.</description></item></channel></rss>
