<p>Since it was on the top of my mind<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, I decided try to

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Now, tell me what an excellent error message from a command line tool should
contain.</strong></p>
<p>An excellent error message from a command line tool should contain the
following elements:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A clear and concise description of the error: The error message should
explain what went wrong and why the command failed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A suggestion for how to fix the error: If possible, the error message
should provide a suggestion for how the user can fix the error and try the
command again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The error code: It can be helpful to include an error code or other
identifier that can be used to look up more information about the error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The context in which the error occurred: Providing information about the
context in which the error occurred (e.g., the command that was being run,
the arguments that were provided) can help the user understand the root
cause of the error and how to fix it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A link to additional resources: If there are additional resources that can
help the user understand and fix the error (e.g., documentation, forums),
it can be helpful to include a link to these resources in the error
message.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll admit this was mildly impressive on the first skim-read. Looking closer, it
became clear that the response is actually flawed in multiple ways and the model
made some assumptions that are not <em>completely</em> accurate.</p>
<p>Overall, this is amusing enough to me that I decided to document it here.</p>

<p>I am currently working on a library to help achieve a great UX around errors
(with a focus on command line tools), based off of my work around <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10421"><code>pip</code>&rsquo;s
error message improvements</a>, <a href="https://sphinx-theme-builder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/errors/"><code>sphinx-theme-builder</code> error

you&rsquo;ll have to wait until I release the library to read the final form of
