I have been fortunate enough to be able to stay safe and also work remotely with some wonderful folks over this time.\nI wrapped up my 3 month GSoC project, after 3 years As you might know, I‚Äôve been working on pip‚Äôs dependency resolver since 2017, which was originally my Google Summer of Code project. There is now a public pip release that uses a new, written-from-the-ground-up dependency resolver, that replaces the old pseudo-dependency-resolver it had. üéâ\nA large part of why this project was finally pushed over the line was that the Packaging-WG at the Python Software Foundation was able to secure funding toward this, from Mozilla (through its Mozilla Open Source Support Awards) and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.\nHuge thanks to Bernard Tyers, Ernest W.

I made it out of that place. As a faculty once told me, ‚Äúyou got to where you are despite this college, not because of it‚Äù.\nMy college has made me sign paperwork that prohibits me from speaking out against university management (something that should speak for itself). Here‚Äôs a link to a relevant section on Wikipedia.\nUpdate: I had to change the link above to a permalink to a specific version of the document, because the linked section was edited out the day I put up this post.\nI mentored a GSoC student I mentored Raphael McSinyx, who worked on pip, exploring speedups to pip‚Äôs dependency resolution process.

Onward to new adventures, I guess.\nI am doing Sphinx-y things now I made a Sphinx documentation theme: Furo, modernised sphinx-themes.org and am collaborating with the amazing folks of the Executable Books project.\nI went to San Francisco CZI conducted an EOSS kickoff meeting, bringing lots of members of their first cohort of 32 EOSS grantees into one room. This included me!\nIt was a really well conducted event, and the room was filled with brilliant people.
