Yea a lot of nerds grok it because we’ve caused enough collective brain damage by being forced to use it over time and it works better for the typical unix tools because they generally just come preinstalled. I think it would just add additional complexity to an already confusing landscape of tools for our end users.\nStatus Quo Debian Well, a lot [has] been said about what Debian does to Python.\nNo default environment management tools pip and venv cover most development workflows1 (as long as the packages you need are pip-installable)\nNo default Python version management tools Some insights based on the Python Packaging Survey One of the reasons I was excited about the PSF getting funding to hire a “Python Packaging Project Manager” was that this role would be able to take on long-term tasks that volunteers can’t reasonably do.2\nTo make sure that readers know of my biases here: This role was funded by Bloomberg and, at the time of this announcement and as of writing this, I’m a member of Bloomberg’s Python Infrastructure team.\nHow we go here Where can we go from here? What can you do to help? The pip is not the same as python -m pip problem The python problem Python doesn’t have a good interpreter version management story. There is no “single” way to say “Get me Python 3.9 and Python 3.10” across supported platforms in a consistent manner.\n“Too complicated” Let’s look at the “out of the box experience” for authoring and publishing a package; using what came with Python and the “dedicated” tools for that task.\nTo get started, you’ll need to create a virtual environment with venv (python -m venv).\nOh, and don’t forget to pip install wheel inside it, or some packages will use setup.py install and have a degraded install3. And, make sure you’re using the right Python from PATH. Oh, and make sure pip and python point to the same thing. Oh, and you might want to use python3.x instead of python or python3 because those could point to something your OS provided that you really shouldn’t use – except, that it’ll seem like it works.\nAll these are subtle failure modes. They exist because – your python may not be the Python you want and may be different from the pip you have.4.\nCreate a scaffold for the package, somehow.\nIf you’re an experienced individual who likes crafting this by hand, knowing each of the trade-offs for every choice you make here: whether to use setuptools or hatchling or flit-core or meson or poetry-core or something else as your “build backend”, whether to have a pyproject.toml file or not, whether to use a “flat” layout or an src/ folder, where to put your packages’ tests, how to manage the various environments you’ll need during development (interactive development, linter, testing, documentation builds, fuzzing etc) and more.\nOr… you use a template through cookiecutter or your-favorite-tool new or your-favorite-tool init (depending on your-favorite-tool).\nLet’s compare that to Rust’s workflow:\nRun cargo new We can embrace that our default out of the box experience will be a largely incoherent one – where the process of authoring to publishing a package will involve, at minimum, 5 different tools (pip, venv, a build-backend, build, twine). In that view, pip is merely an installer. That’s meaningfully diffferent from the current state of thing: it gives us a clear answer to that, and a clear focus long-term – there’s many “bugs”, feature requests and content-for-documentation that can be trimmed given this much smaller scope for the tool – a package installer.\nRoadblocks to improving things Python Lockfiles: A case study Among the seven folks who have the label “pip maintainer”, I can safely say that we share to have a general sense that because pip is a tool that ships with Python, and this is a privedged position within the Python Packaging ecosystem. Implementing certain bits of new functionality that don’t go through a concensus building process that involves every-other-tool in the ecosystem, is a detriment to everyone involved.\nTo pick an example, let’s take lockfiles: it’s technically feasible to implement an arbitrary lockfile format in pip, that evolves with pip, in lock-step with it (we see that’s implemented already in the form of pip-tools). Given the priviledged position that pip has within the ecosystem (i.e. ships with the language), whatever it does would become the “de-facto” standard and commerical tools will add support for that format much quicker (eg: requirements.txt) than something similar from PDM, Poetry or Pipenv.\nAs of today, this means that for implementing something “important” in pip, we’re effectively required to going through a somewhat-exhaustingly long process of a non-iterative, waterfall-style design process for a lockfile format (PEP 665’s slightly iterative process of “we’ll cover the more complicated case later is part of what caused its demise). This is also while trying to satisfy needs to tools that don’t use the same resolution logic – which, we’ll see how that goes, but it’s definitely got a much longer feedback loop associated with it.\nIn summary, we’re in a state where the process for adding new functionality to our default “out of the box” experience is designed to be both very difficult and very “energy” intensive – leading to it being pretty slow. The effect of this is that our “out of the box” experience is always going to be worse than the experience with other tools in the ecosystem.\nIs that what we want?\nThe competition model for Python build-backends Python packaging now has a competition model for build-backends – i.e. tools that handle the generation of installable artifacts from source trees.\nReading “The community spectrum: caring to combative” - Insight From Alex Bayley, the model flagged something amusing to me.\nThe Competitive Spectrum describes communities as being:\nCaring: members are motivated by helping each other. Collaborative: members share goals and help each other to achieve them. Cordial: members have their own goals which do not conflict with each other. Competitive: members share the same goals, and compete against each other to achieve them. Combative: members must achieve their goals by preventing others from being doing so. With the decoupling of the build-backends to allow alternatives to setuptools/distutils to be built, we’ve also moved from a collaborative (or at least, cordial) model for the build mechanisms, to a competitive model for that space.\nAs long as the packages you need are pip-installable. There’s some (now well-documented!) limitations around ↩︎\nI guess I’ll also quickly note that I’d considered (and decided against) bringing up the question of “how exactly are we deciding on the specific tasks that the person who takes on this role will try and fulfil?”.\nI didn’t since it isn’t a thing I wanted to spend an extensive amount of energy on and I’m willing to trust the PSF and the PSF’s Packaging-WG in particular to make the right calls on the specifics here.\nAt this point, the efforts prioritized seem to primarily be focused on the broader goals of sustainability (eg: PyPI org account, Python Packaging “fellowship”) or getting things done that require a long timeline (eg: the Python packaging survey). ↩︎\nThat’s an oversight on the part of… everyone it seems? I just realised that this was happening a few weeks ago. ↩︎\nThis actually affects Python’s development workflows substantially, and gets blamed on “Python Packaging” even though it’s… at best, a shared responsibility between CPython Core Developers, major Linux distributions and the Python Packaging folks. To be clear, there are individuals who wear all three hats.\nAFAIK, there’s also limited energy for improving this among the relevant groups. Reminder that they’re mostly-volunteer groups and, well, you can’t exactly be disruptive and innovative in distribution mechanisms of the most-popular-programming-language (and the lack of “this one way or go away” is also a part of the reason that Python is successful IMO). :) ↩︎\n","wordCount":"1441","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-10-20T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://pradyunsg.me/blog/2022/10/20/the-python-packaging-experience/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Pradyun Gedam","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://pradyunsg.me/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://pradyunsg.me/ accesskey=h title="Pradyun Gedam (Alt + H)">Pradyun Gedam</a>
