I figure that it’ll be useful to actually write it down in a single place, so that I don’t have to repeat myself.\nThe Python Packaging Authority The Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) is a fairly loose group of projects that happen to be related to Python packaging. While the PyPA has a formal governance model, there’s no “oversight” or “enforcement” on projects that are part of the PyPA – they are only required to adopt the PSF Code of Conduct and to be accepted by the existing members.\nFunctionally, each PyPA project is free to do what it wants. The only real benefit of being a PyPA project is the ability to use the PSF as a fiscal sponsor and the ability to say that it’s a “PyPA project”.\nPractically, the PyPA serves as “a body to hammer out \u0026 maintain interoperability specifications” for Python packaging. The PyPA also includes foundational tools that are used in the Python packaging ecosystem, like pip and setuptools.\nRelationship with “Core Python” (I’m using “Core Python” to refer to the Python language and standard library, as maintained by the CPython Core Developers, also known as “core team” for Python)\nAs of the time of writing, Core Python’s involvement in Python Packaging (in a post-distutils world) is fairly limited. The interpreter and Python standard library provide the following pieces, around the packaging ecosystem:\nShipping ensurepip and venv in the standard library.\nvenv supports creating a virtual environment with pip and setuptools1 installed in it. ensurepip provides copies of pip and setuptools1 that are used by venv, and allows bootstrapping the packaging tooling for Python. “site-packages” directories on the import path.\nsite adds site-packages (“global” and “user”) to the import path. site respects the presence of a pyvenv.cfg file (used by venv) to mark a virtual environment, influencing which site-packages it adds to the import path. sysconfig provides relevant paths for placing files and build configuration for the interpreter.\na stable ABI for the C API, for building extensions compatible across Python 3.x (x \u003e= 2).\nDelegation of Python packaging ecosystem decisions The Python Steering Council delegates the decision making for the packaging ecosystem to the Python Packaging Authority (PyPA). This is done through standing delegations to specific PyPA members on specific aspects of Python Packaging. The PyPA is, like CPython Core Developers, a group of volunteers who maintain various bits and pieces of the Python packaging ecosystem.\nThe CPython Core Developers and the PyPA are not the same group of people, but there is meaningful overlap between the two groups. There are 85 “active” CPython Core Developers2 and 50+ (public) PyPA members3. Off the top of my head, I can count 5 people who are active in both CPython and one or more PyPA projects.\nA bit of history From https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/history/:\n2011-02-28: The Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) is created to take over the maintenance of pip and virtualenv from Ian Bicking, led by Carl Meyer, Brian Rosner and Jannis Leidel. Other proposed names were “ianb-ng”, “cabal”, “pack” and “Ministry of Installation”.\nAs “Ministry of Installation” likely implies, these names were chosen partly in jest. The name stuck and, those who started using Python after this name was picked, ended up treating the name at face value. PyPA projects essentially serves as all of the packaging infrastructure for Python making it the de facto authority.\nOver time, “Authority” in PyPA did end up being backed by real authority: the standing delegations from the elected Python Steering Council, ceding control of certain kinds of Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) to specific PyPA members. There’s formal processes, formal interoperability specifications as Python PEPs and a formal governance model.\nTo quote Thomas Kluyver:\nYou don’t get much more authoritative than that without an army.\nWhat about non-PyPA projects? Since PyPA’s inception, there have been non-PyPA projects related to Python packaging (eg: buildout is older than pip). By and large, there isn’t any sort of antagonistic relationship between PyPA and non-PyPA projects. PyPA and non-PyPA project maintainers have often worked together on various things, and many non-PyPA projects are listed as “key projects” for Python packaging.\nFor example, at the time of writing, the two most popular non-PyPA projects are Conda and Poetry. Both of these rely on the interoperability specifications and/or tools that the PyPA works on (conda, poetry) to do what they do.\nSetuptools is gonna be removed, starting with Python 3.12. ↩︎ ↩︎\nBased on the number of eligible votes in the last SC election: https://peps.python.org/pep-8104/#results. “active” is determined as described in Python Language Governance document. ↩︎\nBased on public folks listed in https://github.com/orgs/pypa/people (not all are active though, and there’s active folks who are not members of the GitHub org but have access to the various repositories). ↩︎\n","wordCount":"806","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-14T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://pradyunsg.me/blog/2023/01/14/python-packaging-organisation/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Pradyun Gedam","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://pradyunsg.me/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://pradyunsg.me/ accesskey=h title="Pradyun Gedam (Alt + H)">Pradyun Gedam</a>
