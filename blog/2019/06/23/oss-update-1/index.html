What&rsquo;s up? Over the past few months, I&rsquo;ve worked on a prototype for a resolver in pip, spent some time planning what rolling out a new dependency resolver in pip might look like, and continue to work on pip&rsquo;s build logic to decouple it from the dependency resolution logic.
The prototype has helped me better understand the relationships and contracts between various portions of the codebase. This understanding has led me to conclude that it is a worthwhile investment to better decouple the build logic from the resolution logic, then introduce the abstractions defined in resolvelib/zazo, and then proceed to adopting better dependency resolution."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://pradyunsg.me/blog/2019/06/23/oss-update-1/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.min.162ead5dda599a0c3f3574806db2a636d641f549e195a36b3fb2641eccb9023b.css integrity="sha256-Fi6tXdpZmgw/NXSAbbKmNtZB9UnhlaNrP7JkHsy5Ajs=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><script defer crossorigin=anonymous src=/assets/js/highlight.min.7680afc38aa6b15ddf158a4f3780b7b1f7dde7e91d26f073e6229bb7a0793c92.js integrity="sha256-doCvw4qmsV3fFYpPN4C3sffd5+kdJvBz5iKbt6B5PJI=" onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script><link rel=icon href=https://pradyunsg.me/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://pradyunsg.me/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://pradyunsg.me/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://pradyunsg.me/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://pradyunsg.me/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.82.0"><meta property="og:title" content="What's happening with that pip dependency resolver?"><meta property="og:description" content="I&rsquo;m glad you asked.
