tags: ["Open Source Updates"]
summary: "More (new) Sphinx stuff and rewriting other things."
---

I'm trying to post these roughly once a month.
[Here's the Feb post](/blog/2021/02/27/oss-update-9/).

## Work I did (1 Mar 2021 - 31 Mar 2021)

### Technical

- Started writing a PEP 517 build backend for Sphinx themes.
- Started writing [sphinx-basic-ng], an attempt at modernising the
  Sphinx theme ecosystem.
- Released new versions of [sphinx-autobuild].
- More updates to [Furo].
- Made progress on [installer]'s implementation.
- Made progress on pip's [documentation rewrite].
- Started work on rewriting [ScriptTest], to pay down pip's technical debt.

[installer]: https://github.com/pradyunsg/installer
[get-pip]: https://github.com/pypa/get-pip
[sphinx-autobuild]: https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-autobuild
[sphinx-basic-ng]: https://github.com/pradyunsg/sphinx-basic-ng/
[scripttest]: https://pypi.org/project/scripttest
[documentation rewrite]: https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9475

### Communication

- Talking to relevant folks about `toml` on PyPI (and moving it to... a specific GitHub repository).
- Finally sat down and did an "open source responsibility audit".
- My [social weekends] are still a thing, and has been great so far!
- Still collaborating on designing a lockfile format for Python.
- Added to [The Executable Book Project]'s GitHub organisation! ^>^
- Chatted with a few people about the state of Python and pip on Debian.

## General notes

Looking back, I think I picked up a couple of new projects based on
random brain waves I had! That's perfectly timed, because I've decided
to pivot away from my earlier approach of "yay, more responsibility!".

## What next?

This is getting increasingly harder to decide on, as my free time
chunks are becoming smaller and I'm picking up bigger projects. :)

### Technical

- Sphinx Theme PEP 517 stuff: Make the initial release.
- sphinx-basic-ng: Make the first usable release.
- pip: Clear some of the backlog on the pull request front.
- pip: More progress on the documentation rewrite.

### Communication

- Spend more time looking into the Python lockfile standardisation effort.
- Write a blog post, on automated code formatting.
- Find more speaking opportunities, to talk about things that aren't Python packaging!

## Other commitments

A full time job, that pays my bills. :)
