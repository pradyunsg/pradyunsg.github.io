## Prelude

As you're likely aware, the human world has been quite a different place since my last post here. My transition to this change wasn't super smooth, but hey, it could've been a lot worse. My mental health has definitely had a really fun roller coaster ride. I have been fortunate enough to be able to stay safe _and_ also work remotely with some wonderful folks over this time.

## I wrapped up my 3 month GSoC project, after 3 years

As you might know, [I've been working on pip's dependency resolver since 2017](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2017-February/030083.html), which was originally my Google Summer of Code project. There is now a public pip release that uses a new, written-from-the-ground-up dependency resolver, that replaces the old pseudo-dependency-resolver it had. ðŸŽ‰

A large part of why this project was finally pushed over the line was that the Packaging-WG at the Python Software Foundation was able to secure funding toward this, from Mozilla (through its [Mozilla Open Source Support](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/moss/) Awards) and the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/).

Huge thanks to Bernard Tyers, Ernest W. Durbin III, Georgia Bullen, Nicole Harris, Paul Moore, Sumana Harihareshwara and Tzu-Ping Chung for being amazing colleagues (and friends!) as we worked on this together.

## I have a college degree now

Hurray! I made it out of that place. As a faculty once told me, "you got to where you are _despite_ this college, not because of it".

My college has made me sign paperwork that prohibits me from speaking out against university management (something that should speak for itself). Here's a link to a relevant [section on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vellore_Institute_of_Technology&oldid=992345564#Controversies).

Update: I had to change the link above to a permalink to a specific version of the document, because the linked section was edited out the day I put up this post.

## I mentored a GSoC student

I mentored [Raphael McSinyx](https://mcsinyx.github.io), who worked on pip, exploring speedups to pip's dependency resolution process. You can read more about their work in his [final GSoC report](https://mcsinyx.github.io/gsoc2020/).

## I relocated for a job

I am now working at Bloomberg Engineering as, currently, a part of the Python Infrastructure team in London.

I'm officially no longer living in my parent's home. Onward to new adventures, I guess.

## I am doing Sphinx-y things now

I made a Sphinx documentation theme: [Furo], modernised [sphinx-themes.org](https://sphinx-themes.github.io/sphinx-themes.org/) and am collaborating with the amazing folks of the [Executable Books](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/) project.

## I went to San Francisco

[CZI conducted an EOSS kickoff meeting](https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/meetings/#essential-open-source-software-for-science-kickoff-meeting), bringing lots of members of their first cohort of 32 EOSS grantees into one room. This included me!

It was a really well conducted event, and the room was filled with brilliant people. I felt like a squirrel in a room full of elephants.

This happened _right before_ COVID-19 was deemed serious enough to care about it. It was the last trip I had in the before-times, and it was definitely a good one.
