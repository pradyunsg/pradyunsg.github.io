I'm trying to post these roughly once a month.
[Here's the March post](/blog/2021/04/03/oss-update-10/).

## Work I did (1 May 2021 - 30 Jun 2021)

### Technical

- Made significant progress on pip's documentation rewrite.
- More progress on [installer]'s usability.
- Finally completed the restructuring of pip's distribution via https://bootstrap.pypa.io/. Shoutout to @ewdurbin who did most of the magic here. :)
- A lot of issue tracker triage (and mostly saying no) for [Furo].
- Sphinx 4 compatibility for [Furo].
- Wrote my own VS Code editor UI theme, finally.
- Sphinx: More progress on $theme-I-am-writing.

### Communication

- PyPA logistics for moving pipx and cibuildwheel.
- Passively involved in the editable installs standardisation process.

If you wanna talk to me on a weekend, I'm still doing open [social weekends]. :)

## General notes

Nothing to say here this time.

## What next?

Some more wrapping up of ongoing projects, since I actually didn't really do
that as I'd hoped for.

### Technical

- Make further progress on pip's documentation rewrite.
- installer: Finalise and make a stable release.
- Sphinx: Continue iterating on `sphinx-basic-ng`.
- Sphinx: Continue iterating on $theme-I-am-writing.
- Sphinx: Continue iterating on the PEP 517 backend.

### Communication

- Spend time on the Python lockfile standardisation effort.
- Help with the July pip release.

## Other commitments

A full time job, that pays my bills. :)
