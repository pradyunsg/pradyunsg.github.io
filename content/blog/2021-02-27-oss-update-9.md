Alrighty! Let's start doing this again. <!--more--> The plan is to get
back to doing these roughly once a month again.

## Work I did (1 Jan 2021 - 26 Feb 2021)

### Technical

- Published the last version of pip that supports Python 2! ðŸŽ‰
- Published a few releases of [Furo] -- a Sphinx theme I wrote.
- Made some (unreleased) changes to [sphinx-autobuild].
- Made some more progress on [installer] -- a reusable library for Python (wheel) package installation.
- Rewrote [`get-pip.py`][get-pip] and the generation pipeline for it.
- Started a rewrite of pip's documentation.
  [I'd love to get some feedback on this.][pip-docs-rewrite]

[get-pip]: https://github.com/pypa/get-pip
[sphinx-autobuild]: https://pypi.org/p/sphinx-autobuild
[pip-docs-rewrite]: https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/9474

### Communication

- I'm experimenting with a new thing: [social weekends]!
- I presented 2 talks at FOSDEM: in the [Python devroom] and
  [Open Source Design devroom]. Shout-out to Bernard Tyers, for all the help and
  the bazillion reminders to make sure I do all the things on time. :)
- Collaborating on designing a lockfile format for Python, that can hopefully
  be standardised for interoperability.

## General notes

Onboarding in a new company, relocating internationally, settling into a new
space has been... well, it's all been a very interesting learning experience.

Given the fairly strict lockdown and the percentage of people wearing masks
in my locality, I've spent a _lots_ of time indoors. Looking forward to the
social weekends experiment I'm doing.

## What next?

### Technical

- pip: Work on the documentation rewrite, hopefully to get it ready in time for
  the next release.
- pip: Clear some of the backlog on the pull request front.
- pip: General discussions for new features and enhancements.
- TOML: Work on writing that the compliance test suite.
- TOML: Bring `toml` for Python back from the dead.
- Furo: Make the first stable release.
- Start work on the other Sphinx theme I have in mind.

### Communication

- Spend more time looking into the Python lockfile standardisation effort.
- Catch up on the Python-on-Debian saga, and see how I can contribute
  constructively.

## Other commitments

Oh, I have a full time job at Bloomberg now. :)
