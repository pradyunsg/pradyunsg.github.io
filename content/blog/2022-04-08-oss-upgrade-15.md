## What next?

There's PyCon US close to the end of the month! That's the first in-person event
that I've bought tickets for since 2020!

There's going to be a Python Packaging Summit, at PyCon US this year -- I'm one
of the organisers. I am also going to be at the event for sprints.

## Other commitments

A full time job that pays my bills. :)
