  <= 16 (from ~2019).
- Worked on Sphinx 5 compatibility for various bits of the Sphinx ecosystem that
  I maintain.

- Built CPython documentation with Lutra.

### Community

- Getting the Packaging PEPs into a consistent state.
- Start moving Python Packaging standards to packaging.python.org.
- Engage in a discussion about Bokeh moving off of `setup.py`.
- Get PEP 668 over the line and... it's accepted!
- Start poking at PEP 625, to get the ball rolling on that again.
