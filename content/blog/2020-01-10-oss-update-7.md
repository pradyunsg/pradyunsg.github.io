title: "OSS Work update #7"
tags: ["Open Source Updates"]

I'm trying to post these roughly once a month. [Here's the December post](/blog/2019/12/11/oss-update-6/).

I am working on open source projects, as part of an internship at [FOSSEE](https://fossee.in/) and as a part of grant-funded work on pip's dependency resolver.

## Work I did (Dec 11 - Jan 5)

### Technical

- Wrore and adopted `vendoring` for use in pip.
  - Initiated conversation for pipenv to switch to it too.
- Made progress toward TOML 1.0, via useful clarifications in the specification
- Continued tackling pip’s build logic refactoring.
  - Refactoring of pip's wheel building logic.
  - Designing a "package builder" library -- figuring out what Python Packaging's "build" step should look like to end users.
- Started reviewing virtualenv’s rewrite.
- PR Reviews: ~25, including improvements to pip’s installation logic, better wheel-related error messages and more.

### Communication

- A few release manager-y things:
  - (I'll be the release manager for pip 20.0)
  - Identified tasks that need to happen prior to pip's release.
- Discussions on discuss.python.org:
  - Giving pip an API
    https://discuss.python.org/t/2833
  - Python Packaging in GSoC 2020
    https://discuss.python.org/t/2830
  - PyPA governance PEP
    https://discuss.python.org/t/2619
- Discussions on issue trackers:
  - New Resolver: technical choices
    https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7406
  - Switch to a dedicated tool for vendoring pip's dependencies
    https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/7485
- Provided helper/starter for pip's UX review work.
- Onboarded a new triager to pip: Welcome Stéphane Bidoul! :)

## Additional notes on challenges

December was fairly productive, until the end of the month, when the holidays
came in and I also wasn't in the best of health.

I couldn't come up with a good talk topic for PyCon US 2020. :/

## Goals for January 2020

### Technical

- Onboard and co-work with a developer, on pip.
- Triage pip's issue tracker. A lot.
- Spend some time improving pip's test suite infrastructure.
- Investigate Python 2 usage from PyPI, to identify anomalies.

### Communication

- Ensure pip 20.0's release goes well (I'm the release manager).
  - Yay automation that I worked on a little while back!
- I'll be very active on PSF's Zulip instance, as part of the grant-funded work on pip's resolver.

## Other commitments

None.

## Help us

How can you help us?

- provide test cases where the latest released version of pip (19.3.1, at the time of writing) fails to resolve dependencies properly (on [zazo's issue tracker][zazo-issues]). They will help us design and test the new resolver.
- talk with your company about becoming a PSF sponsor. The [Fundable Packaging Improvements page][fundable-projects] lists fairly well-scoped projects that would happen much faster if we get funding to achieve them.
