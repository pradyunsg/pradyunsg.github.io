I am a software engineer, who likes to work on improving the experience of using
software for other humans. I have a keen interest in open source software, with
deep experience with developer tooling and technical writing & communication.

I help maintain critical projects that serve as the digital infrastructure for
the Python ecosystem. I have been recognized as a Python Software Foundation
Fellow for my work in the community. I have also given talks at many Python
meetups and conferences.

At my day job, I make it easier for software developers to write software in
Python; as part of [Bloomberg Engineering]â€™s Python Infrastructure team.

Here's an audio clip of [how to say my name].

## Community Engagement

I'm fairly all over the place on this front -- in that, I actually end up doing
a lot of stuff that don't quite fit the categories earlier on this page.

The best place to see the detailed overview of how I've helped various
community-driven open sources projects is, like, stalking me on GitHub?
