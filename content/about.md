I am a software engineer, who likes to work on improving the experience of using
software for other humans. I have a keen interest in open source software, with
deep experience with developer tooling and technical writing & communication.

I wear many hats in open source software spaces, including maintaining critical
projects that serve as the foundational digital infrastructure for the ecosystem
of the [Python programming language], making it easier to create good technical
documentation websites and being involved in community events.

My current day job is to make it easier for software developers to write
software in Python; as part of [Bloomberg Engineering]â€™s Python Infrastructure
team.
